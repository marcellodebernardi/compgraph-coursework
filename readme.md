#ECS610S COMPUTER GRAPHICS

GitHub project for the weekly lab coursework. Details for each
lab below.

## 1 - WEEKLY LAB MILESTONES

### WEEK 1, Points and Vectors - done
The Implement data types representing points and vectors in 3D
space, including basic operations on them.

### WEEK 2, Faces and Objects - done
Implement a geometry.Face class and a geometry.GObject class, which use the
classes from week 1 to store face vertices and face colors.

### WEEK 3, Matrics, 3D Transformations, and geometry.Face Orientation - done except vector transform
Construct a class for 4x4 matrices, and use them to transform
points and vectors.

### WEEK 4, graphics.Scene and Animation
Implement a graphics.Scene class, which uses GObjects, reads them
from a file, and draws them using a camera.

### WEEK 5, Parallel Projection (with live demo)

### WEEK 6, Perspective Projection I (with live demo)

### WEEK 7, Perspective Projection II


## 2 - IMPROVEMENTS AND TODOS
