#ECS610S COMPUTER GRAPHICS

GitHub project for the **ECS610S Computer Graphics** module coursework.
The coursework was awarded a grade of 100%.


## SPECIFICATION
The coursework consists of a 3D animation in `java.awt`, incrementally
developed over the course of 7 lab lessons. Each lab lesson builds
on top of the previous ones. Additional features, not specified in the
labs but discussed during the module, have to be added. This includes
things such as visibility determination, back face elimination,
clipping, and shading.


## STRUCTURE
The `geometry` package contains the classes defining the geometric
primitives used in modeling, such as points, vectors, faces, and
meshes. The `graphics` package contains classes pertaining to
drawing and animating a scene with use of a camera.


## RUNNING IT
A release .jar is available for the project. Use instructions are printed
to standard output when the application is run, explaining what keys can
be used to interact with the animation. This includes camera translation,
zoom, viewing modes, and more.
